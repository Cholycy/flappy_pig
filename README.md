1. I'm recently getting my hands on rust with a book 'Hands on Rust', and try to play rust with some simple games followed by the book description. 
2. Under src/, there exists two files: backup_main.rs(totally same as the example provided in the book) and main.rs(add some improvement based on backup_main.rs, such as move the object forward or backward...)
3. Happy Coding :)
